# Organo - Learning ReactJS with Alura

This project is part of one of the many [Alura](https://www.alura.com.br/) courses that I have taken to improve my web development skills and to learn ReactJS framework. Alura is an online platform that offers courses on various topics, such as programming, design, data science, marketing, and more. I highly recommend Alura to anyone who wants to learn new technologies and techniques in a practical and engaging way.
